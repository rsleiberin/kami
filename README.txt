AGI Process Documentation for kami
Introduction:
kami is an ambitious project aimed at achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through modular, multi-modal contextual training for neural networks. The following document outlines the primary process flow and methodology employed by the system.

1. System Overview:
The kami architecture emphasizes the registration of modules via the module registry and orchestrates their interaction through the context manager/core. All code standardization is managed by the pseudo_utils.txt file within the utils directory after the foundational code skeleton has been established.

2. Initialization:

Initialize all core sockets and load auxiliary sockets.
Load user preferences, historical interactions (if any), and initial system configuration.
Initialize sub-agent registry (to manage and track sub-agents).
3. AGI Active Loop:
While the AGI system remains active, it undergoes several phases, including:

User Input Analysis: Capture and analyze user input to determine intent and validate for ambiguities.

Requirement Mapping: Map the intent to system requirements, validating and prioritizing based on system capabilities and user preferences.

Sub-Agent Creation and Management: If the intent relates to long-term autonomous tasks, create and manage sub-agents accordingly.

Dynamic Task Reduction and Coding: Analyze requirements to determine coding tasks, then generate necessary code for each task.

Integration & Testing: Seamlessly integrate the dynamically generated code and test for functionality.

Feedback Loop for Dynamic Adjustments: Iterate over feedback from testing to refine and improve the generated code.

Event-Driven Activation: Respond to specific events that require special context handling or intervention.

Continuous Learning: Ensure the AGI system continuously observes, learns, and adjusts based on interactions.

Sub-Agent Monitoring and Interaction: Oversee and interact with sub-agents, monitoring their status and updates.

Periodic Self-Review: Identify and decommission outdated or redundant sockets and modules.

Internal Improvement Detection and Action: Proactively detect and implement potential internal optimizations or enhancements.

System Readiness and Responsiveness: Ensure the AGI system remains responsive to new inputs or events.

4. Future Extensions and Roadmap:
Potential areas for future expansion, as well as planned feature rollouts, will be detailed here.
