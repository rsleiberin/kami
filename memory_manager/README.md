# Project Kami - Memory Management System

## Introduction
The Memory Management System directory deals with the dynamic storage, retrieval, and management of context and data for LLMs. It facilitates the real-time interaction of LLMs with their memory structures, ensuring the efficient storage of information and the ability to adapt to evolving memory needs.

## Status
- `In Progress`

## Tasks
- [ ] Read and adhere to the guidelines in `documentation/standards/coding_and_development/coding_workflow.md`.
- [ ] Understand and document the existing memory structures.
- [ ] Design the database architecture tailored for dynamic interactions.
- [ ] Develop mechanisms for on-demand table creation.
- [ ] Establish protocols for LLMs to request memory expansions.
- [ ] Build efficient data retrieval mechanisms.
- [ ] Ensure all data operations are secure and efficient.
- [ ] Test the database with real-world scenarios for robustness.
- [ ] Update the README as tasks progress.

## Files
- `In Progress`: [database_design.py](./database_design.py) - Blueprint for the dynamic database architecture.

(Additional files to be added as development progresses)

## Directories
(None currently available)

## Special Considerations
### For Humans
Ensure that the memory structures designed are optimized for quick read and write operations. Regularly backup data to prevent loss.

### For AIs
Always check for memory availability before attempting to store new data. Maintain data integrity during all operations.
