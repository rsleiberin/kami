- Method: receive_from_chat_gpt
  - Description: This method is responsible for handling the response received from ChatGPT. 
    The response can contain a function call that needs to be executed.
  
  - Start
    - Print tracer: Signal the start of the method
  - Check for None Response
    - If the response is None, exit the method
  - Try
    - Parse the JSON string received from ChatGPT
    - Extract function call data, if any
      - If a function call is present:
        - Print tracer: Signal that a function call is being handled
        - Extract the function name and arguments
        - Call the corresponding function with the given arguments
  - Catch JSONDecodeError
    - Print tracer: Signal an error occurred during JSON decoding
  - Finally
    - Print tracer: Signal the end of the method

- Traceability:
  - This method is mainly invoked after receiving a response from ChatGPT via the `send_to_chat_gpt` method.
  
- Testing:
  - Unit tests should be written to ensure that the function can handle both valid and invalid JSON strings, and that it correctly invokes the corresponding functions when a function call is present.

- Method Connectivity:
  - This method connects with the `handle_function_call` method when a function call is received.
