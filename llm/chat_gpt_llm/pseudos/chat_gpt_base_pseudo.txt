Pseudo-code for chat_gpt_base.py

1. Import necessary modules and classes
    - Import ContextManager from context_management
    - Import OPENAI_API_KEY from config
    - Import print_tracer from utils
    - Import classes for extension (Loop, Send_Receive, Functions) 

2. Define the ChatGPTAssistant class
    2.1 Initialization (__init__)
        - Start print_tracer with method "__init__" and event "Start"
        - Initialize API key, system message, and ContextManager
        - End print_tracer with method "__init__" and event "End"
        
3. Main Function (__main__)
    - Start print_tracer with method "__main__" and event "Start"
    - Initialize the ChatGPTAssistant class
    - Print a message indicating the assistant is ready
    - Start the assistant loop by calling the `loop` method
    - End print_tracer with method "__main__" and event "End"

Method Connectivity:
- The __init__ method initializes the key components required for the assistant to function.
- The __main__ function initializes the assistant and starts the main loop.
