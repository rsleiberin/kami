1. Import necessary utility functions.
2. Extend the existing ChatGPTAssistant class to include a 'loop' method.

Method: loop
--------------
1. Start Tracing: Initialize the main loop and wait for user input.
2. Display a message indicating the assistant is ready.
3. Enter an infinite loop to handle user interactions:
    1. Try to execute the following steps:
        1. Wait for user input and strip it.
        2. If the input is empty, notify the user and continue the loop.
        3. Fetch the current context from the Context Manager.
        4. Send the context and user input to ChatGPT.
        5. Process the response:
            1. If a valid response is received, display it.
            2. Otherwise, indicate failure.
    2. Handle exceptions:
        1. KeyboardInterrupt: Exit the loop.
        2. Other Exceptions: Log the error and continue the loop.
4. End Tracing: Exiting the main loop.
