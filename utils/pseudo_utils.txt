Utility Method Standardization Guide:
1. Import Section:
Begin with the necessary import statements.
Group and order imports following Python's PEP8 guidelines: standard libraries, third-party libraries, application libraries.
2. Trace Function:
Always include the print_tracer function in utility files.
Format: print_tracer(module_name, method_name, event, additional_info="").
Example: print_tracer("Utils", "get_methods", "Start", "Inspecting Object Methods").
Purpose: Provides standardized tracing for debugging and context awareness.
3. Utility Methods:
Initiate with a clear docstring explaining the method's purpose.
Follow with the method signature.
At the method body's start, call print_tracer with the "Start" event.
For significant events or stages inside the method, insert additional print_tracer calls.
At the method body's end, before returning, call print_tracer with the "End" event.
4. Error Handling:
Incorporate try-except blocks in methods that might raise exceptions.
In the exception block:
Call print_tracer with the "Error" event.
Handle the error using the standardized handle_error function. Ensure this method is part of the utilities and imported wherever needed.
The handle_error method should:
Fetch error details based on an error code.
Use print_tracer to trace the start and end of the error retrieval.
Handle exceptions that might arise during error retrieval, providing a fallback error message.
For dynamic addition of third-party error codes, use the add_error_codes function to integrate them into the central ERROR_CODES dictionary.
5. Return Statements:
Be explicit about the return.
If a method can return multiple types (e.g., a list, dictionary, or None), clearly document this in the method's docstring.
6. Consistency:
Apply this guide consistently across all utility methods.
Periodically review and refine this guide as the application evolves.
7. Error Code Format:
Each error should have a unique code.
Structure the error code as XX###, where XX is a two-letter module abbreviation, and ### is a sequential number.
Each error code should correspond to a detailed message, HTTP status, severity, description, and resolution.
8. Templates:
Class:
class ClassName:
    """
    A brief class and its purpose description.
    """
Function:
def function_name(arg1: type1, arg2: type2, ...) -> return_type:
    """
    A brief function description.
    """
9. Best Practices:
Stick to the DRY principle: Don't Repeat Yourself.
Ensure to write unit tests for utility methods to confirm their correctness.
Refactor the codebase regularly to maintain its quality and readability.
Future-proof the utilities by incorporating functionalities that can dynamically adjust based on new requirements.
With these updates, the guide should be comprehensive and adaptable to future changes, especially when third-party modules get integrated.
