Safety System Overview
The safety system for Project Kami incorporates various measures to ensure the robustness and security of the system. These include:

Whitelist Layer: A static list of commands and functions that are universally approved for execution.
User-Specific Permissions Layer: Personalized permissions that allow users to set boundaries for what their AGI can and can't do.
Human-in-the-Loop Layer: A fail-safe layer where a human operator must give the final approval for specific actions.
Identity Binding: The AGI is tied to the identity of an individual at the core level, ensuring personalized safety.
Traceability: All actions and function calls are logged for review and potential rollback.
Dynamic Risk Assessment: Real-time evaluation of actions based on a risk scoring system.
