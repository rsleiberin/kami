# Code Standardization Guide for Project Kami

## Import Section
1. Group and order imports following Python's PEP8 guidelines: standard libraries, third-party libraries, application libraries.

## Code Formatting
1. Follow Python's PEP 8 style guide for code formatting.
2. Use meaningful variable and function names to improve readability.
3. Use comments sparingly and only when the code isn't self-explanatory.

## Error Handling
1. Use try-except blocks in methods that might raise exceptions.
2. Handle the error using the standardized handle_error function.

## Return Statements
1. Be explicit about what is being returned.
2. If a method can return multiple types (e.g., a list, dictionary, or None), clearly document this in the method's docstring.

## Consistency
1. Apply this guide consistently across all codebases and modules.

## Future-proofing
1. Write code in a way that it can be easily extended or modified.
2. Avoid hardcoding values; instead, use constants or configuration files.
