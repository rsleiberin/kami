# Project Kami - Response Processor

## Introduction
The Response Processor directory is integral to handle diverse responses from LLM API calls. Its purpose is to ensure that each component of a response, be it a function call, message, or context edit, is processed appropriately and directed to the correct module.

## Status
- `In Progress`

## Tasks
- [ ] Read and adhere to the guidelines in `documentation/standards/coding_and_development/coding_workflow.md`.
- [ ] Understand the various response types from LLMs.
- [ ] Develop parsers for these response types.
- [ ] Implement safety checks for all incoming data.
- [ ] Route parsed data to the relevant modules efficiently.
- [ ] Handle overlapping and concurrent API calls.
- [ ] Test the response processor with diverse LLM outputs.
- [ ] Update the README as tasks progress.

## Files
- `In Progress`: [response_parser.py](./response_parser.py) - Handles parsing of LLM responses.

(Additional files to be added as development progresses)

## Directories
(None currently available)

## Special Considerations
### For Humans
Monitor the response logs to ensure correct data routing. Regularly update the parser to accommodate evolving LLM response structures.

### For AIs
Ensure parsed data retains its integrity and context. Always prioritize safety checks before routing data.
