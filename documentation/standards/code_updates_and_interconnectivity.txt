Code Updates and Interconnectivity Standards Guide

1. Version Control:
   - Use a version control system like Git to track changes and updates in the codebase.
   - Document any major changes in the version history.

2. Backward Compatibility:
   - Ensure that new changes are backward-compatible with older versions of the code.
   - If breaking changes are necessary, document them clearly.

3. Module Interconnectivity:
   - Clearly define APIs for module interaction.
   - Use consistent naming and structure for functions that are designed to interact with other modules.

4. Dependency Management:
   - Clearly document any new dependencies introduced during updates.
   - Use package management tools to lock versions of dependencies.

5. Testing:
   - Ensure that changes in one module do not break functionality in others.
   - Run unit tests and integration tests after updates to confirm compatibility.

6. Update Rollouts:
   - Roll out updates in phases, and use feature flags where possible.
   - Monitor the behavior of the updated module, especially when it interacts with other modules.

7. Monitoring and Logging:
   - Implement logging to track interactions between modules.
   - Use monitoring tools to alert you of any issues in real-time.

8. Documentation:
   - Update the documentation to reflect any changes in module interaction or functionality.
   - Include examples of the new interactions if applicable.

9. Review Process:
   - Code changes should go through a review process for quality assurance.
   - Use peer review and automated checks for this purpose.

10. Decommissioning:
    - When decommissioning a module or feature, ensure to properly remove or deprecate the corresponding code.
    - Update all affected modules accordingly.
