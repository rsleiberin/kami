Method Definitions and Error Handling Standards Guide

1. Method Definitions:
   - Start with a clear, concise docstring that describes the method's purpose.
   - Use type hints for method arguments and return types.

2. Input Validation:
   - Validate method arguments to ensure they meet the expected criteria.
   - Use assertions or custom validation functions for this purpose.

3. Trace Function:
   - Use the `print_tracer` function at the start and end of the method for debugging and context awareness.

4. Error Handling:
   - Use try-except blocks to catch and handle errors.
   - Utilize the `handle_error` function for standardized error handling.

5. Error Logging:
   - Log errors using Python's logging module or a similar logging system.

6. Return Statements:
   - Be explicit about what the method returns.
   - If a method can return multiple types, document this in the method's docstring.

7. Testability:
   - Design methods to be easily testable.
   - Consider parameters that might be mocked during testing.

8. Reusability:
   - Design methods to be reusable across different parts of the application.
  
9. Modularity:
   - Keep methods small and focused on a single task.

10. Exception Types:
    - Use specific exception types rather than generic ones for more precise error handling.

11. Fallback Strategies:
    - Implement fallback strategies for methods that interact with external systems or services.
