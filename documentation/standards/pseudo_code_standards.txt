Pseudo-Code Standards Guide

1. Purpose:
   - Pseudo-code serves as a high-level representation of the code logic, aiding both development and maintenance.

2. Structure:
   - Pseudo-code should be structured to mimic the code's structure, including loops, conditionals, and function calls.

3. Tags and Markers:
   - Use specific tags or markers to correlate lines in the pseudo-code with the actual code.

4. Traceability:
   - Include a parameter in debugging functions to accept a reference line from the pseudo-code. This aids in tracing back to the original intent.

5. Connectivity:
   - Describe how the method in focus connects to other methods, especially if they are in different modules.

6. Testing Annotations:
   - Include comments in the pseudo-code describing the types of tests that should be written for the described functionality.

7. Updates:
   - Pseudo-code should be updated whenever the actual code changes.

8. Documentation:
   - Include a section in each code file dedicated to pseudo-code to provide a quick understanding of the code's logic.

9. Versioning:
   - If the pseudo-code changes significantly, consider versioning it.

10. Review:
    - Periodically review the pseudo-code to ensure it aligns with the current codebase.

11. Examples:
    - Provide examples for complex algorithms to aid understanding.

12. Inclusion in Code Review:
    - Pseudo-code should be part of the code review process to ensure that it accurately represents the implemented logic.

13. Storage:
    - Store the pseudo-code in a location easily accessible to all team members, such as a dedicated section in each code file or a centralized document.
