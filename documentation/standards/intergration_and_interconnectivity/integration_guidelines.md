### Integration Guidelines for Project Kami

#### Introduction

This document outlines the guidelines for integrating various modules within Project Kami. Following these guidelines will ensure that the modules interact seamlessly, thereby maintaining the project's overall integrity.

#### Basic Principles

1. **Modularity**: Each module should be designed to perform a specific task and should be independent enough to be plugged into the system without affecting other modules.

2. **Compatibility**: Modules should be designed to be compatible with each other. This involves using standard data formats, protocols, and interfaces.

3. **Scalability**: The integration process should accommodate the addition of more modules in the future without requiring significant changes to the existing system.

4. **Error Handling**: Proper error-handling mechanisms should be in place to catch and manage any errors that might occur during the integration process.

#### Guidelines

1. **Test Isolation**: Before integrating a new module, ensure it functions as expected when isolated from the system.

2. **Interface Agreements**: Clearly define and document the interfaces through which the modules will interact.

3. **Version Control**: Always maintain version control to keep track of changes made during the integration process.

4. **Integration Testing**: After integrating a new module, perform rigorous integration tests to validate that the system functions as expected.

5. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date documentation of the integration steps, including any changes made to the modules or the system at large.
