## Steps
1. **Requirement Gathering**: Collect all user and system requirements.
2. **Requirement Analysis**: Analyze the requirements for feasibility and scope.
3. **Design Planning**: Create design documents that outline the architecture and data flow.
4. **Design Review**: Review the design with stakeholders for approval.

## Involved Standards
- Coding Standards
- Project Initialization

## Broader System Fit
Understanding requirements and having a well-thought-out design are foundational steps in the development process. They set the stage for effective coding, testing, and ultimately, successful project completion.
