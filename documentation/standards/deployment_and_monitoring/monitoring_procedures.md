# Monitoring Procedures for Project Kami

## Introduction
This document outlines the monitoring procedures within Project Kami, focusing on real-time audit logs and system performance.

## Monitoring Steps

1. **Real-Time Audit Logs**: 
   - Monitor the audit logs generated by `execute_function_with_audit` in real-time.
  
2. **Alerts for Anomalies**: 
   - Configure alerting mechanisms to notify in case of anomalous entries in the audit logs.

3. **System Performance Metrics**: 
   - Monitor CPU, memory, and other key performance metrics.

## Special Considerations
### For Humans
