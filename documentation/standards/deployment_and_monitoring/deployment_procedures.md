# Deployment Procedures for Project Kami

## Introduction
This document outlines the procedures to be followed for deploying new code or updates within Project Kami. It serves as a guide for both human developers and AI agents.

## Steps for Deployment

1. **Preparation**: 
   - Ensure all code has passed unit tests.
   - Verify that code adheres to the coding standards of Project Kami.

2. **Use Audit Function**: 
   - Call `execute_function_with_audit` from the `audit_and_rollback` module for all crucial or high-risk deployments. 
   - This will take a snapshot of the system and log the deployment activity for auditing.

3. **Execute Deployment**: 
   - Run the deployment scripts or commands.
  
4. **Verify Deployment**: 
   - Ensure that the deployed code is running as expected.

5. **Monitoring**: 
   - Check the audit logs for any anomalies or issues.

## Special Considerations
### For Humans
- Always review the audit logs post-deployment for any issues or anomalies.

### For AIs
- Ensure to call `execute_function_with_audit` for high-risk activities and deployments.
