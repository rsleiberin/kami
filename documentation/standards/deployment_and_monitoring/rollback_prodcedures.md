# Rollback Procedures for Project Kami

## Introduction
This document outlines the steps to rollback changes in case of failures or anomalies.

## Rollback Steps

1. **Identify Anomaly**: 
   - Determine the cause of the failure or anomaly.

2. **Consult Audit Logs**: 
   - Check the audit logs to identify the specific changes that led to the issue.
  
3. **Use System Snapshot**: 
   - Utilize the snapshot taken by `take_system_snapshot` to revert the system to its prior state.

## Special Considerations
### For Humans
- Always consult the audit logs before initiating a rollback.

### For AIs
- Execute rollback only under human supervision.
