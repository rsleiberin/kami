Testing and Code Quality Standards Guide

1. Test Structure:
   - All tests are to be completed as Unicode tests and should be stored in a separate 'test' directory.
   - The 'test' directory should mirror the structure of the actual project, with each file having its own unit tests.

2. Test Granularity:
   - Write unit tests for each function or method to ensure it behaves as expected.
   - Use functional and integration tests to validate that different components work together correctly.

3. Test Naming:
   - Test names should be descriptive and indicate what they are testing.

4. Test Documentation:
   - Each test should have a docstring briefly explaining what it does.
  
5. Test Automation:
   - Aim to automate as much of the testing as possible to ensure that regressions are caught quickly.

6. Code Coverage:
   - Strive for high code coverage but prioritize meaningful tests over coverage percentage.

7. Code Quality:
   - Use linting tools to ensure code quality and adherence to coding standards.
   - Use code review processes to ensure code quality and correct functionality.

8. Error Handling:
   - Tests should also cover error conditions, not just the 'happy path'.

9. Test Data:
   - Use representative test data that mimics real-world conditions as closely as possible.

10. Version Control:
    - Keep tests up to date with code changes and version control them along with the code.

11. Continuous Integration:
    - Integrate testing into a CI/CD pipeline to run tests automatically when code changes.

12. Review:
    - All tests should be reviewed periodically to ensure they are up-to-date and cover all critical parts of the application.
