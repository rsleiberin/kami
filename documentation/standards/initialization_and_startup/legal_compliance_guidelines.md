# Legal and Compliance Guidelines for Project Kami

## Introduction
This document outlines the legal and compliance frameworks that Project Kami adheres to. It's crucial for both human collaborators and AI agents to understand these guidelines to ensure the project remains compliant with industry standards and ethical norms.

## Open Source License
Project Kami is released under an open-source license to encourage the collaborative improvement of the technology and to accelerate its adoption in solving real-world problems. Despite the geopolitical risks associated with the technology's capabilities, it is the belief of the project that the benefits outweigh the risks.

### License Type
Project Kami uses the MIT License, which allows for free use, modification, and distribution of the code. Users are not obligated to share their changes but are encouraged to contribute back to the community.

## Geopolitical Considerations
While open source in nature, Project Kami's technology has the potential for misuse. We encourage ethical use and hope that it serves as a force for good. However, users are urged to consider the geopolitical implications of their use of this technology.

### Technology Export Controls
As of the last update of this document, Project Kami is not subject to technology export controls. However, users are responsible for complying with any future regulations that might apply.

## User Data and Privacy
While Project Kami itself does not collect third-party data, it interfaces with other systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT, which have their own data handling policies. Users should be aware of these when integrating Project Kami with third-party systems.

## Security Measures
Security is a priority for Project Kami. All contributors are encouraged to follow best practices in coding and data management. The project has embedded safety systems for autonomous agents, detailed in a separate document. For more information on general security measures, refer to the `Security_Best_Practices.md` file.

## Disclaimer
While we strive to adhere to all legal and ethical norms, the rapidly evolving landscape of AI and technology, in general, may outpace the updates to this document. As such, this should not be considered legal advice.
