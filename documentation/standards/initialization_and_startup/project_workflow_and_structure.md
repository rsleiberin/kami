# Project Workflow and Structure

## Introduction
This comprehensive guide outlines both the workflow for onboarding and the structure for task navigation in Project Kami. It serves as a manual for humans and AI agents alike to understand how tasks are identified, assigned, and tracked.

## Status Indicators
- `In Progress`: Currently being worked on and may contain incomplete tasks.
- `Completed`: All tasks within this directory or file have been finalized.
- `Deprecated`: No longer in use; should generally be avoided.

## Task Assignment and Identification

### How to Pick Tasks
1. **Start at the Top-Level README**: This provides an overview of the project and the current status of each directory.
2. **Navigate to Incomplete Directories**: Use the README files as a breadcrumb trail to find directories that are not yet complete.
3. **Pick a Task**: Choose a task that aligns with your expertise and the project's current needs.
4. **Mark Task as In Progress**: Update the README to indicate that the task is in progress.
5. **Complete the Task**: Work on the task until it's complete.
6. **Update the README**: Once the task is complete, update the README to mark it as complete.
7. **Move Up**: Once all tasks in a directory are complete, move up to the parent directory and update its README to mark the sub-directory as complete.

### Additional Tips for Identifying Tasks
- **Status-Based Navigation**: Look for directories and files marked `In Progress` for areas requiring attention.
- **Consult READMEs**: They will have a "Goals" or "Tasks" section outlining what needs to be done.
- **Upstream Directories**: If a directory is marked `Completed`, but its parent directory is `In Progress`, consult the parent directory's `README.md`.
