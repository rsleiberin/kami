# Module Integration Process

1. **Dependency Resolution**: Before integrating a new module, assess the dependencies that the module requires and how they align with existing system components.

2. **Compatibility Checks**: Verify if the new module is compatible with the existing modules and system infrastructure.

3. **Initial Testing**: Perform unit tests on the new module to ensure its functionality is as expected.

4. **Integration Testing**: After the module is integrated, run integration tests to ensure that it works well with existing modules.

5. **Rollback Plan**: Always have a rollback plan in case the new module integration causes system instability.

6. **Documentation**: Update the system documentation to reflect the new module integration, explaining its purpose, how it fits into the overall architecture, and any new dependencies.

7. **Monitoring and Logging**: Set up necessary monitoring and logging for the new module to track its performance and any issues that arise.

# Module Integration Process

## Purpose
This document outlines the procedures and best practices for integrating new modules into the AGI system. 

## Scope
This standard applies to all modules that will be added to the AGI system, whether they are core modules, auxiliary modules, or third-party modules.

## Pre-integration Checklist
- Validate that the module meets all security standards.
- Ensure that the module does not conflict with existing modules.
- Review module documentation and understand its functionality.

## Integration Steps
1. **Repository Cloning**: Clone the repository of the new module into the development environment.
2. **Dependency Resolution**: Ensure that all dependencies are resolved.
3. **Configuration**: Configure the module as per system requirements.
4. **Testing**: Conduct unit and integration tests.
5. **Code Review**: Review the module code for adherence to coding standards.
6. **Documentation**: Update system documentation to include the new module.

## Post-integration
- Monitor the module's performance and error logs.
- Update the module as necessary for performance optimization and security patches.

## Rollback Plan
- A rollback plan should be in place in case the module causes system instability.
