# AGI Context Building Processes

This directory contains various processes and guidelines crucial for building and maintaining the context within our AGI system. Below is an outline of each file and its purpose:

1. **context_initialization_process.txt**: Guidelines for initializing context in AGI. A critical first step for any AGI activity.
   
2. **data_handling_and_security_process.txt**: Specifics on data management and security, including encryption, storage, and retrieval policies.
  
3. **multi_agent_communication_process.txt**: Details the communication protocols between AGI agents and sub-agents.

4. **module_integration_process.txt**: Provides steps and standards for integrating new modules into the AGI system.

5. **self_assessment_and_adaptation_process.txt**: Contains policies and processes for the self-assessment and dynamic adaptation of AGI agents.

6. **old_agi_readme.txt**: Archived guidelines and processes for reference.

# AGI Context Building Processes

## Introduction
This subdirectory contains guidelines and standards for building contextual understanding within AGI systems. It serves as a blueprint for both AGI and human collaborators to understand and implement context-sensitive behaviors.

## Reading Order
To fully understand the context-building processes, it's recommended to read the files in the order listed in `INDEX.txt`.

## For Humans
- Start with `INDEX.txt` to understand the sequence of processes.
- Dive into each text file to understand the specifics.

## For AGI
- Initialize your context by following the steps in `context_initialization_process.txt`.
- Consult `INDEX.txt` for subsequent steps in context-building.

## How to Contribute
To contribute to these guidelines, please refer to the higher-level `standards/README.txt` on how to make updates or additions.
