
AGI Context-Building Process for Code Creation:
Context Initialization

Involved Standards: Project Overview, Method Definitions, and Error Handling
Steps: AGI identifies the scope and nature of the task. Initializes a context object that will hold relevant data, parameters, and state.
Requirement Understanding

Involved Standards: Method Definitions and Error Handling, Pseudo Code Standards
Steps: AGI interprets the requirements and expectations. Builds a conceptual model or pseudocode.
Environment Assessment

Involved Standards: Import Standards, File Structure Standards
Steps: AGI assesses the current state of the environment, such as available resources, existing modules, and how they can be leveraged.
Code Generation

Involved Standards: Code Standardization Guide, Method Definitions and Error Handling, Pseudo Code Standards
Steps: AGI generates code based on the conceptual model, following coding standards and guidelines.
Debugging and Error Handling

Involved Standards: Debugging and Context, Method Definitions and Error Handling
Steps: AGI runs initial tests, captures errors, and refines the code.
Context Enrichment

Involved Standards: Code Updates and Interconnectivity, Documentation and Comments
Steps: AGI updates the context object with new insights, relationships between modules, and potential areas for optimization.
Integration Planning

Involved Standards: Integration Process
Steps: AGI plans how the new code will integrate with existing systems, considering dependencies and data flow.
Self-Testing

Involved Standards: Testing and Code Quality
Steps: AGI simulates the integration and runs tests to ensure compatibility and performance.
Context Finalization

Involved Standards: None yet (could be added)
Steps: AGI finalizes the context object, summarizing the outcomes, learnings, and next steps.
Monitoring and Feedback Loop

Involved Standards: None yet (could be added)
Steps: After deployment, AGI monitors performance and uses feedback to enrich its context for future tasks.
This flow aims to make the AGI self-sufficient in building context while adhering to best practices. The process allows for incremental learning and adaptation, which are essential for a self-improving system.
