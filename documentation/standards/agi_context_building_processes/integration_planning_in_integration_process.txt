# Integration Planning Process

## Introduction
Integration planning is the step where the AGI determines how the new code will integrate with existing systems. This process includes considering dependencies, data flow, and other factors that could affect integration.

## Objective
To plan and outline the steps required for seamlessly integrating new components or modules into the existing AGI framework.

## Steps
1. **Dependency Mapping**: Identify all dependencies related to the new code or component.
2. **Data Flow Analysis**: Analyze how data will flow between the new component and existing components.
3. **Resource Allocation**: Determine what resources are needed for integration and allocate them accordingly.
4. **Timeline Estimation**: Provide a time estimate for the integration process.
5. **Risk Assessment**: Identify any risks associated with the integration and propose mitigation strategies.
6. **Validation**: Validate the integration plan by running a set of predefined tests or checks to ensure that it is robust and achievable.

## Broader System Fit
Integration planning is critical for ensuring that new components fit seamlessly into the existing AGI architecture. A well-planned integration reduces the risk of errors and ensures that the AGI system remains cohesive and functional.
