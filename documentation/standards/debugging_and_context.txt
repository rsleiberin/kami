Debugging and Context Standards Guide

1. Debugging Tools:
   - Choose a standard set of debugging tools suitable for the project.
   - Make sure the tools are well-documented and easy for new team members to learn.

2. Debugging Levels:
   - Establish different debugging levels (e.g., INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR) to filter out log messages.
   - Utilize these levels in your debugging tools.

3. Context Preservation:
   - Use context variables to maintain state information across function calls and modules.
   - Implement context managers for resource allocation and deallocation.

4. Trace Functions:
   - Incorporate trace functions like `print_tracer` to provide real-time insights into code execution.
   - Utilize trace functions at the start and end of significant code blocks.

5. Exception Handling:
   - Use try-except blocks for sections of code that might raise exceptions.
   - Implement standardized error handling and logging mechanisms.

6. Performance Metrics:
   - Utilize performance metrics like execution time, memory usage, etc., to identify bottlenecks.
   - Document these metrics for future reference.

7. Code Reviews:
   - Regularly conduct code reviews to identify debugging and context preservation issues.
   - Use automated tools where possible to assist in the review process.

8. Documentation:
   - Maintain up-to-date documentation for debugging tools and practices.
   - Include example use-cases and scenarios where applicable.

9. Testing:
   - Implement unit tests that mimic real-world scenarios to check for debugging and context issues.
   - Periodically update these tests to include newly discovered edge cases.

10. Continuous Monitoring:
    - Use continuous monitoring tools to automatically detect and report issues.
    - Integrate this with your debugging tools for seamless issue resolution.

11. Real-world Scenarios:
    - Periodically conduct tests in an environment that mimics real-world conditions to evaluate debugging and context preservation capabilities.
