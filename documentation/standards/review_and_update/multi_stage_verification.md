#### Introduction
Multi-Stage Verification serves as an advanced safety layer in Project Kami's code review system. This document outlines the guidelines for incorporating Multi-Stage Verification into the review process.

#### Overview
The Multi-Stage Verification process involves multiple checks and balances to ensure that the code meets the highest standards of quality and safety. This includes:
- Whitelist Layer
- User-Specific Permissions
- Risk Assessment
- Peer Review

#### Whitelist Layer
The whitelist layer is the first line of defense, ensuring that only pre-approved commands and functions are executed. Any code that does not pass this layer is automatically rejected.

#### User-Specific Permissions
This layer allows the user to set specific limitations on what the AGI can and cannot do. These permissions are personalized and can be adjusted according to the needs and preferences of the individual user.

#### Risk Assessment
The risk assessment layer involves a real-time evaluation of the proposed code changes. Each action is assigned a risk score, and if the cumulative score exceeds a certain threshold, the code is flagged for manual review.

#### Peer Review
In cases where the risk assessment layer flags a piece of code, a peer review is initiated. Multiple human reviewers assess the code and must come to a unanimous decision for the code to be approved or rejected.

#### Conclusion
The Multi-Stage Verification process adds an extra layer of security and reliability, ensuring that the code meets the stringent standards set by Project Kami.
