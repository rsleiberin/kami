# Documentation Guidelines for Project Kami

## Introduction
This document outlines the guidelines for creating and maintaining documentation within Project Kami. Documentation is essential for explaining the architecture, modules, functions, and overall behavior of the system. It is a key resource for both human developers and AI agents.

## General Guidelines

### Be Clear and Concise
Documentation should be written clearly and concisely, avoiding unnecessary jargon or verbosity.

### Use Proper Formatting
Use Markdown for text formatting, code snippets, and other structural elements.

### Keep Up-to-Date
Documentation should be updated as changes are made to the system. Outdated documentation can be misleading and counterproductive.

### Include Examples
Whenever possible, include code examples to demonstrate how a particular function or module should be used.

## Types of Documentation

### Project-level Documentation
This type of documentation provides an overview of the project, its purpose, and high-level architecture. It should be the starting point for anyone new to Project Kami.

### Module-level Documentation
Each module should have its own dedicated documentation explaining its purpose, features, and how it fits into the larger system.

### Function-level Documentation
Documentation at the function level should describe what a function does, its parameters, return values, and any exceptions it may raise.

## Special Sections

### Prerequisites
Include any prerequisites needed to understand the documentation, such as prior reading or technical knowledge.

### FAQs
Consider adding a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) section for addressing common queries or challenges.

### Glossary
Include a glossary to define any specialized terms or acronyms used in the documentation.

## Examples

### Python Docstrings
In Python, function-level documentation can be written as docstrings:

\`\`\`python
def example_function(param1, param2):
    """
    This is an example function that does X.
    
    Parameters:
    - param1: Explanation
    - param2: Explanation
    
    Returns:
    Explanation of the return value
    """
    pass
\`\`\`

## Conclusion
Good documentation is crucial for the long-term maintainability and success of Project Kami. Both human developers and AI agents should strive to adhere to these guidelines.
