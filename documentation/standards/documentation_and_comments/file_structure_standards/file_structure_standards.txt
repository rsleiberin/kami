# File Structure Standards for Project Kami

## Directory Structure
1. Each major module (e.g., Safety, ChatGPT) should have its own directory.
2. Within each module directory, files should be organized based on their functionality.
3. Common utility functions should reside in a `utils` directory.

## File Naming
1. Main files in each module should be named `module_base.py`.
2. Helper methods and classes should be in separate files named `module_method.py` or `module_class.py`.
3. All file names should be in snake_case.

## Class Separation
1. Each class should be in its own file within the respective module's directory.
2. The base file of each module should import all the classes and methods that the module uses.

## Sub-Directories
1. Include a `pseudos` directory for storing pseudo-code related to each module.

## Special Files
1. `__init__.py`: This should be present in every module directory to indicate it's a Python package.
