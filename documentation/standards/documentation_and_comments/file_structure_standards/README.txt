# File Structure Standards

## Introduction
The file structure standards outline how the directories and files should be organized within Project Kami to maintain consistency and ease of navigation.

## Guidelines
1. **Directory Naming**: Use snake_case for directory names.
2. **File Naming**: Use snake_case for file names. Add suffixes to indicate the type of the file (e.g., `_test` for test files).
3. **File Extensions**: Use `.txt` for text files, `.py` for Python files, etc.

## Broader System Fit
Adhering to these file structure standards ensures that both humans and AGIs can easily locate and understand the purpose of various files and directories, facilitating smoother development and operation.
