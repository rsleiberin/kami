Integration Process Standards Guide

1. Modularization:
   - Break down large code files into smaller, manageable modules.
   - Create a `base` file for each module, along with additional files for each method.

2. Version Control:
   - Use Git or another version control system for tracking changes.
   - Create feature branches for each integration process.

3. Dependency Management:
   - Use a package manager like `pip` for Python to manage dependencies.
   - Clearly document all dependencies in a `requirements.txt` file.

4. Testing:
   - Run unit tests for each module before integrating.
   - Perform integration tests after combining modules.

5. Code Review:
   - Before merging, conduct code reviews to ensure that new changes align with existing code.
   
6. Rollback Plan:
   - Always have a rollback plan in case an integration introduces new issues.

7. Documentation:
   - Update the project's documentation to reflect any new integrations or changes.

8. Monitoring:
   - Once integrated, monitor the system for any performance issues or bugs.

9. Feedback Loop:
   - Establish a feedback mechanism for tracking the success or failure of an integration.

10. Final Validation:
    - Once all steps are complete, perform a final validation to ensure that all components work together seamlessly.

11. Update Strategy:
    - Plan how the integrated components will be updated in the future. Determine whether they need to be updated simultaneously or if they can be updated independently.
