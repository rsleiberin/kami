# Project Kami Testing Procedure Guidelines

## Introduction
This document sets forth the guidelines for testing code within Project Kami. It is intended to standardize the testing process across different classes, modules, and features, ensuring robust and reliable code.

## Types of Testing

### 1. Unit Testing
- Test individual methods and functions in isolation.
- Ensure that each unit of code performs its intended function.
  
### 2. Integration Testing
- Test the interaction between different units of code.
- This ensures that the units work together as expected.

### 3. End-to-End Testing
- Test the entire application or feature to ensure it meets the defined requirements.

## Testing Phases

### 1. Test Planning
- Define what needs to be tested, based on the README and project requirements.
- Create a test plan that outlines the scope, objectives, and criteria for each type of test.

### 2. Test Development
- Write the actual test cases, adhering to the guidelines set forth in this document.
  
### 3. Test Execution
- Run the tests and document the results.
- If a test fails, identify the issue, fix it, and rerun the test.

### 4. Standards and Review
- Once testing is completed, perform a standards check using `standards_checklist.md`.
- Make any necessary revisions and rerun the tests until they align with Project Kami standards.

## Human-AI Collaboration
- The human provides high-level direction and validates that the tests meet the project requirements.
- The AI is responsible for developing and executing the test cases, adhering to the guidelines in this document.

## Conclusion
Adhering to these testing procedures will ensure that the code within Project Kami is robust, reliable, and meets the defined requirements. This is crucial for the long-term success of the project.
