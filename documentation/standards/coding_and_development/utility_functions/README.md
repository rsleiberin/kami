# Project Kami - Utility Functions

## Introduction
This directory contains guidelines and standards for utility functions used in Project Kami. These utility functions serve as the foundational building blocks and "breadcrumbs" that assist in tracing and debugging, primarily for the Limited Language Model (LLM) but also for human developers.

## Status
- `PENDING`

## Tasks
- [ ] Document the `get_methods` function for dynamic method retrieval.

## Files
The following files are listed in the suggested reading order (do not include this README):
- `COMPLETED`: [print_tracer.md](./print_tracer.md) - Guidelines for using the `print_tracer` function for context awareness.
- `PENDING`: [get_methods.md](./get_methods.md) - Instructions on how to use `get_methods` for method retrieval.
- `COMPLETED`: [error_handling_and_error_code_format.md](./error_handling_and_error_code_format.md) - Standards for handling errors and formatting error codes.
- `COMPLETED`: [utility_function_standards.md](./utility_function_standards.md) - Standards and best practices for creating and maintaining utility functions.
