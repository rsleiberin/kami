# Project Kami - Utility Functions

## Introduction
This directory contains guidelines and standards for utility functions used in Project Kami. These utility functions serve as the foundational building blocks and "breadcrumbs" that assist in tracing and debugging, primarily for the Limited Language Model (LLM) but also for human developers.

## Status
- `In Progress`

## Tasks
- [ ] Document the `print_tracer` function for standardized tracing.
- [ ] Document the `get_methods` function for dynamic method retrieval.
- [ ] Document `error_handling_and_error_code_format` for standardized error handling and formatting.
- [ ] Develop guidelines for creating new utility functions.
- [ ] Create a guide for utility function best practices.

## Directories
(None currently available)

## Files
The following files are listed in the suggested reading order (do not include this README):
- `COMPLETED`: [print_tracer.md](./print_tracer.md) - Guidelines for using the `print_tracer` function for context awareness.
- `PENDING`: [get_methods.md](./get_methods.md) - Instructions on how to use `get_methods` for method retrieval.
- `COMPLETED`: [error_handling_and_error_code_format.md](./error_handling_and_error_code_format.md) - Standards for handling errors and formatting error codes.

## Special Considerations
### For Humans
- Read through all the files in the suggested reading order for a comprehensive understanding of utility functions in Project Kami.

### For AIs
- Follow the documentation closely for context setup. The utility functions assist in maintaining and understanding the project context.
