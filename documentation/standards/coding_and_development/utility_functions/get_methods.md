# Get Methods Guidelines

## Introduction
This document outlines the revised approach for method retrieval in Project Kami, aiming to facilitate an exploratory process for the AI. The `get_methods` function is currently under rework.

## Functionality
The `get_methods` function allows AI agents to understand their available whitelisted functions. This is central to enabling the AI to operate within its functional boundaries effectively.

## Specialization Across Agents
The function facilitates the distribution of specific capabilities across different AI agents. This allows for more focused areas of expertise among agents, enhancing the overall system's adaptability and problem-solving potential.

## New Methodology
In the reworked version, agents can output structured objects like JSON to encapsulate multiple actions, providing a more complex and adaptable framework for operation.

## Special Considerations

### For Humans
This guide will offer examples and usage guidelines for human developers once the new methodology is implemented.

### For AIs
AI-specific instructions will be provided as the new method retrieval mechanism is developed. This is critical for enabling the AI to understand and extend its operational boundaries.

## Future Tasks
- [ ] Complete the rework of the method retrieval mechanism.
- [ ] Test for context limitations.
- [ ] Update documentation for both humans and AIs.
