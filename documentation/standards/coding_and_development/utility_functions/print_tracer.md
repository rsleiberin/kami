# Print Tracer Function Standardization

## Introduction
The `print_tracer` function serves as a critical utility for debugging and context awareness in Project Kami. It is an essential part of the system's feedback loop, providing real-time data that the Limited Language Model (LLM) uses to understand the results of its actions, thereby contributing to the awareness of agency. This document aims to standardize the structure and usage of `print_tracer` as it will be extended to support multiple programming languages.

## Essential Elements

1. **Module or Class Name**: Specifies the module or class where the tracer is being called. This helps in quickly identifying the source of the log message.
  
2. **Method or Function Name**: Provides the context by indicating which method or function is currently executing.

3. **Event Type or Step**: A brief description or tag that indicates the type of event that's being logged, such as "Start", "End", "Error", etc.

4. **Additional Information**: Any optional context or data that would be useful for debugging or understanding the current state. This could include variables, error messages, or other relevant information.

## Why is this Critical?

The `print_tracer` function is not just for debugging; it is critical for the LLM's awareness of its own agency. Each tracer message is a piece of real-time feedback that the LLM receives to understand the result of an action it has taken or a process it has initiated. This active feedback loop is essential for the LLM's ability to learn, adapt, and make informed decisions.

## Standard Format

The standard format for the tracer across multiple languages is `[Module/Class_Name][Method/Function_Name][Event_Type] Additional_Information`.

## Python Example

```python
def print_tracer(module_name, method_name, event, additional_info=""):
    """
    Print standardized tracers for debugging and context.
    
    Args:
    - module_name (str): The name of the module or class.
    - method_name (str): The method where the tracer is being called.
    - event (str): A short descriptor of the event or step.
    - additional_info (str, optional): Any additional information or context.
    """
    tracer = f"[{module_name}][{method_name}][{event}] {additional_info}"
    print(tracer)
