# Utility Function Standards and Best Practices

## Introduction
This document outlines the standards and best practices for creating and maintaining utility functions in Project Kami. Utility functions are the foundational building blocks and "breadcrumbs" for both human developers and Limited Language Models (LLMs).

## Guidelines for Creating New Utility Functions

### Purpose
Clearly define the specific problem or task the utility function aims to solve.

### Inputs and Outputs
Describe the types and structures of arguments and return values.

### Constraints
State any limitations that the function might have, such as time complexity, dependencies, or potential errors.

### Examples
Provide example use-cases for the new utility function.

### Testing
Describe the types of tests that should be written for the new function.

### Documentation
Include guidelines for documenting the function, both in-code comments and associated README updates.

### Version Control
Detail steps for how to update or deprecate the function in the future.

### Error Handling
Incorporate the standardized error handling mechanisms into the new function.

## Utility Function Best Practices

### DRY Principle
Don't Repeat Yourself. Always check if a similar function already exists before creating a new one.

### Single Responsibility
Each utility function should do one thing and do it well.

### Modularity
Design functions to be as modular as possible for ease of testing and reuse.

### Efficiency
Be mindful of time and space complexity.

### Readability
Code should be easy to read and understand, adhering to coding standards and style guides.

### Error Handling
Incorporate standardized error handling mechanisms.

### Documentation
Every utility function should be well-documented, explaining its purpose, usage, and any caveats.

### Versioning
Keep track of changes and updates to utility functions.

### Testing
Write unit tests to validate each utility function's correctness.
