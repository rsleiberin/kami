# Python Dependency Management Guidelines for Project Kami

## Introduction
Managing dependencies is a crucial part of any Python project. This document outlines the recommended best practices for managing Python dependencies in Project Kami.

## Using `pip`
- All developers are expected to use `pip` for installing Python packages.

## `requirements.txt`
- The `requirements.txt` file, located in the root directory, will list all dependencies required for the project.
- The file should specify the most compatible version of each package.

## Adding New Dependencies
- When a new package is needed, first test it for compatibility and any conflicts with existing packages.
- Add the new dependency to the `requirements.txt` file.

## Updating Dependencies
- Periodically review and update the packages to their latest compatible versions.
- Before updating any package, ensure it does not introduce breaking changes.
- After updating, regenerate `requirements.txt` by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

## Virtual Environments
- For better isolation and avoiding dependency conflicts, consider using a virtual environment using tools like `venv`.

## Special Considerations
- Any deviation from these guidelines must be justified and documented.
