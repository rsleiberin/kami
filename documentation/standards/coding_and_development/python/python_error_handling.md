# Python Error Handling Guidelines for Project Kami

## Introduction
This document outlines best practices for error handling in Python within Project Kami. Following these guidelines ensures consistent error reporting and handling across the system.

## Types of Errors
Refer to the `ERROR_CODES` constant for a complete list of error types specific to Project Kami. This serves as the central repository for all errors and should be updated whenever a new error is introduced.

## Try-Except Blocks
Use try-except blocks to catch and handle errors gracefully. This prevents the program from crashing and allows for better debugging.

\`\`\`python
try:
    # Code that might raise an exception
except SomeException as e:
    handle_error("SomeErrorCode")
\`\`\`

## Custom Exceptions
If the standard Python exceptions do not cover a specific error scenario in Project Kami, you can create custom exceptions. Make sure to document these in the `ERROR_CODES` constant.

\`\`\`python
class CustomError(Exception):
    pass
\`\`\`

## Logging Errors
Use `print_tracer` to log the error events. The logging should provide enough context to understand what went wrong, where, and why.

\`\`\`python
print_tracer("ModuleName", "MethodName", f"Error encountered: {str(e)}")
\`\`\`

## Error Handling in Multi-Agent Systems
This section is reserved for future updates when multi-agent systems are implemented in Project Kami.

## Deprecation and Future Updates
Regularly review the code to identify and replace deprecated error handling mechanisms.

## Versioning
If the error handling is dependent on the version of a third-party library, make sure to document this.

## Future Tasks
- [ ] Extend error handling guidelines to multi-agent systems when implemented.

## Special Considerations
### For Humans
Refer to the utility functions documentation for standardized error handling and formatting.

### For AIs
Follow the `ERROR_CODES` constant for understanding the types of errors and their handling.
