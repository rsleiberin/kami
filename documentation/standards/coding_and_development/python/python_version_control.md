\# Version Control Practices in Python for Project Kami

\## Introduction
Version control is not just an essential practice for software development, but it's crucial for the collaborative and multi-agent nature of Project Kami. This document outlines the version control guidelines tailored for Python development within Project Kami.

\## Branching Strategy
Choose a branching strategy that best fits the development and release cycle. Commonly used strategies include Git Flow and GitHub Flow. 

\## Commit Messages
Commit messages should be meaningful and follow a standard format. A commonly used format is \<type\>(\<scope\>): \<subject\>. For example:
\`\`\`python
\# Good example
git commit -m "feat(auth): add login API"
\`\`\`

\## Code Reviews
Code reviews are mandatory before merging any branch into \`main\`. This ensures code quality and knowledge sharing.

\## Tagging Releases
For every major or minor release, create a tag. Semantic versioning is often used:
\`\`\`python
git tag -a "v1.0.0" -m "Version 1.0.0"
\`\`\`

\## Changelog
Maintain a \`CHANGELOG.md\` file at the root of the repository to keep track of all the changes made in different versions.

\## Stashing
Use git stash when you need to switch branches but don't want to commit the changes in the wrong branch.
\`\`\`python
git stash save "Your stash message"
\`\`\`

\## Rebasing
Rebase is a powerful tool, but it can be dangerous if not used correctly. Always prefer \`git merge\` for public branches and \`git rebase\` for cleaning up local branches.
\`\`\`python
git rebase -i HEAD~3  \# Interactive rebase for the last 3 commits
\`\`\`

\## Conflict Resolution
In case of a merge conflict, resolve the conflict manually. After resolving, mark it as resolved and continue the rebase.
\`\`\`python
git add .
git rebase --continue
\`\`\`

\## Future Tasks
- [ ] Include guidelines for using \`.gitignore\`.
- [ ] Add strategies for rollbacks.
- [ ] Documentation for third-party tools like Git Hooks.
