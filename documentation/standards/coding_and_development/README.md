# Project Kami - Coding and Development Standards

## Introduction
This directory serves as the comprehensive guide for coding and development standards within Project Kami. It lays the groundwork for the creation of self-improving AGI with modular components and is highly relevant for both human developers and AI agents.

## Status
- `PENDING`

## Tasks
- [ ] Create language-specific standards (Python, Frontend, Database)

## Files
The following files are listed in the suggested reading order (do not include this README):

- `COMPLETED`: [coding_workflow.md](./coding_workflow.md) - Describes the iterative development and coding workflow.
- `COMPLETED`: [class_structure.md](./class_structure.md) - Standards for organizing classes and their methods.
- `COMPLETED`: [iterative_development.md](./iterative_development.md) - Guidelines for iterative development and task decomposition.
- `COMPLETED`: [testing_procedure.md](./testing_procedure.md) - Describes testing procedures, including unit and integration tests.
- `COMPLETED`: [README_updates.md](./README_updates.md) - Guidelines for updating README files within Project Kami.


## Directories
The following directories are listed in the suggested reading order:
- `PENDING`: [utility_functions](./utility_functions) - Standards and guidelines for utility functions across languages.
- `PENDING`: [python](./python) - Standards and best practices for Python development.
- `PENDING`: [frontend](./frontend) - Guidelines for frontend languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- `PENDING`: [database](./database) - Best practices for database languages like SQL.

## Special Considerations
### For Humans
- Follow the directories and files listed above in the suggested reading order for a comprehensive understanding of coding and development standards.

### For AIs
- Consult the directories and files for initial context setup and ongoing operational guidelines.
