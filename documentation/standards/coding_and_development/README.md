# Project Kami - Coding and Development Standards

## Introduction
This directory serves as the comprehensive guide for coding and development standards within Project Kami, laying the groundwork for the creation of self-improving AGI with modular components. It is highly relevant for both human developers and AI agents working on the project.

## Status
- `In Progress`

## Tasks
- [ ] Create language-specific standards (Python, Frontend, Database)
- [ ] Tackle AI context management challenges
- [ ] Develop AGI logic and pseudo-code translation processes
- [ ] Standardize pseudo-code, its traceability, and testing
- [ ] Ensure consistency in utility methods across languages
- [ ] Define best practices and the DRY principle

## Files
The following files are listed in the suggested reading order:
- `COMPLETED`: [unique_method_file_structure.md](./unique_method_file_structure.md) - Guidelines for the unique method file structure in Project Kami.
- `In Progress`: [agi_logic_pseudo_code_process.md](./AGI_Logic_Pseudo_Code_Process.md) - Outlines the development process utilizing pseudo-code for AGI.
- `In Progress`: [standards_checklist.md](./standards_checklist.md) - A checklist for evaluating code against Project Kami's coding standards.
- `In Progress`: [testing_procedure.md](./testing_procedure.md) - Guidelines for the testing procedures in Project Kami.
- `In Progress`: [iterative_development.md](./iterative_development.md) - Details the iterative development process in Project Kami.
- `In Progress`: [class_structure.md](./class_structure.md) - Guidelines for structuring classes in Project Kami.

## Directories
The following directories are listed in the suggested reading order:
- `PENDING`: [utility_functions](./utility_functions) - Standards and guidelines for utility functions across languages.
- `PENDING`: [python](./python) - Standards and best practices for Python development.
- `In Progress`: [frontend](./frontend) - Guidelines for frontend languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- `In Progress`: [database](./database) - Best practices for database languages like SQL.

## Special Considerations
### For Humans
- Follow the directories and files listed above in the suggested reading order for comprehensive understanding of coding and development standards in Project Kami.

### For AIs
- Consult the directories and files for initial context setup. Pay special attention to AI_Context_Management.md for strategies on managing limited context.
