# Import Standards

## Introduction
The import standards guide outlines the best practices for importing modules and libraries in Project Kami.

## Guidelines
1. **Standard Library Imports**: Always import standard Python libraries first, followed by third-party libraries.
2. **Grouping**: Group imports by standard library, third-party, and Project Kami-specific.
3. **Alphabetical Order**: Sort imports alphabetically within each group.
4. **Avoid Wildcard Imports**: Do not use wildcard imports (e.g., `from module import *`).

## Broader System Fit
Following these import standards will ensure code consistency and readability, making it easier for both human developers and AGIs to understand and maintain the codebase.
