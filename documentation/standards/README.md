# Project Kami - Coding and Development Standards

## Introduction
This directory serves as the comprehensive guide for coding and development standards within Project Kami. It is highly relevant for both human developers and AI agents working on the project.

## Status
- `In Progress`

## Tasks
- [ ] Create language-specific standards (Python, Frontend, Database)
- [ ] Document unique method file structure
- [ ] Provide LLM library update guidelines
- [ ] Tackle AI context management challenges
- [ ] Develop AGI logic and pseudo-code translation processes
- [ ] Ensure consistency in utility methods across languages
- [ ] Address error handling standards
- [ ] Define best practices and the DRY principle
- [ ] Standardize pseudo-code, its traceability, and testing
  
## Directories
The following directories are listed in the suggested reading order:
- `In Progress`: [python](./python) - Standards and best practices for Python development.
- `In Progress`: [frontend](./frontend) - Guidelines for frontend languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- `In Progress`: [database](./database) - Best practices for database languages like SQL.
- `In Progress`: [Utility_Functions](./Utility_Functions) - Guidelines and standards for universal utility functions like `print_tracer` and `get_methods`.
- `In Progress`: [Pseudo_Code_Standards](./Pseudo_Code_Standards) - Guidelines for pseudo-code standardization, traceability, and testing.

(None currently available)

## Files
The following files are listed in the suggested reading order (do not include this README):
- `In Progress`: [AGI_logic_pseudo_code_process.md](./AGI_logic_pseudo_code_process.md) - Outlines the development process utilizing pseudo-code for AGI.
- `In Progress`: [print_tracer.md](./print_tracer.md) - Guidelines for the `print_tracer` utility function, critical for context management.
- `In Progress`: [updated_get_methods.md](./updated_get_methods.md) - Describes the revised approach for method retrieval, replacing the old `get_methods`.

## Special Considerations
### For Humans
- Follow the directories and files listed above in the suggested reading order for comprehensive understanding of coding and development standards in Project Kami.

### For AIs
- Consult the directories and files for initial context setup. Pay special attention to AI_Context_Management.md for strategies on managing limited context.
