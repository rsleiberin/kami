## Project Overview for Project Kami

### 1. Introduction:
   - Project Kami aims to create a self-improving AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) with modular components for upgradability and self-introspection through multi-agent socketry.

### 2. Project Structure:
   - The project is structured around a central module controller with modular programming sockets. These sockets allow for autonomous agents to connect to approved software.

### 3. Key Technologies:
   - Python, Flask, Modular Neural Networks, Context Management Techniques, Whitelisting for Security

### 4. Data Flow:
   - Data flows through a centralized controller that manages interactions between various modular components and external software through approved APIs.

### 5. Future Roadmap:
   - The roadmap includes enhancing the AGI's self-improving capabilities, adding more modular components, and refining the multi-agent system.

### 6. Project Dependencies:
   - Flask for web application, various Python libraries for data manipulation and machine learning.

### 7. Version History:
    - The project will maintain a version history documenting major updates and what they entail.

### 8. Contact Information:
    - Project maintainers or support team contact information will be provided.
