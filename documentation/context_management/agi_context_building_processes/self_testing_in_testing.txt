# Self-Testing Process

## Introduction
Self-testing is an essential part of the AGI's operational flow. It involves simulating the integration and running tests to ensure compatibility and performance. This document outlines the standardized process for self-testing within the AGI system.

## Objective
To validate that new components or modules work as intended and are compatible with the existing architecture.

## Steps
1. **Prepare Test Environment**: Isolate the component or code to be tested from the production environment.
2. **Identify Test Cases**: Enumerate the different scenarios under which the component will operate.
3. **Run Simulations**: Simulate interactions with other components and systems to check for issues.
4. **Performance Benchmarking**: Evaluate the performance of the component under various conditions.
5. **Error Logging**: Log any errors or discrepancies discovered during the testing.
6. **Review and Analysis**: Analyze the test results and identify areas for improvement.

## Involved Standards
- Testing and Code Quality

## Broader System Fit
Self-testing ensures that newly developed components or modifications are ready for integration into the larger AGI system. It reduces the risk of introducing errors and helps maintain the overall quality and reliability of the system.
