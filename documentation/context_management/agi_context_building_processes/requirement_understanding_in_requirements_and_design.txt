# Requirement Understanding in Requirements and Design

## Introduction
Requirement understanding is a crucial step in the AGI's operational process, coming after context initialization. It sets the stage for aligning the AGI's capabilities with the user's needs and expectations. 

## Objective
To interpret and clarify the requirements and expectations of the user or system. To build a conceptual model or pseudocode that outlines how the requirements will be achieved.

## Steps
1. **Interpret User/System Requirements**: Analyze the given requirements to understand their scope and complexity.
2. **Clarify Ambiguities**: If the requirements are not clear, take steps to clarify them. This could involve asking the user for more information or consulting other modules.
3. **Map to System Capabilities**: Evaluate how the requirements map to the AGI's current capabilities. Identify any gaps that need to be filled.
4. **Create Conceptual Model/Pseudocode**: Develop a conceptual model or pseudocode that outlines how the requirements will be met.
5. **Validate Requirement Understanding**: Use predefined tests or checks to validate that the requirements have been understood correctly.

## Involved Standards
- Method Definitions and Error Handling
- Pseudo Code Standards

## Broader System Fit
Understanding requirements is vital for subsequent processes like environment assessment, code generation, and integration. It ensures that the AGI works in alignment with user needs and system capabilities, making it a key step in the AGI's operational flow.
