# Context Finalization Process

## Introduction
Context finalization is the concluding step in the AGI's context-building process. This document outlines the standardized procedures for finalizing the context within the AGI system.

## Objective
To summarize the outcomes, learnings, and next steps, ensuring that the AGI is prepared for the next cycle of operations or can gracefully exit the current context.

## Steps
1. **Context Summary**: Create a summary of the outcomes and learnings from the current context.
2. **Data Archiving**: Store any relevant data, logs, or outputs for future reference or analysis.
3. **Resource Deallocation**: Safely deallocate any computational or memory resources used during the context's lifecycle.
4. **System State Update**: Update the AGI's state to reflect the completion of the context.
5. **Next Steps**: Identify any subsequent tasks or processes that should be initiated after this context.

## Involved Standards
- Method Definitions and Error Handling

## Broader System Fit
Context finalization provides a structured way to conclude any AGI operation. It ensures that the system has a well-defined endpoint, making it easier to transition to new tasks or states.
