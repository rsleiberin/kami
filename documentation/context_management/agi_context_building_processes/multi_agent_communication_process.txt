# Multi-Agent Communication Process

1. **Communication Protocols**: Specify the protocols to be used for inter-agent communication, such as HTTP, WebSocket, etc.

2. **Data Formats**: Define the data formats for the messages, like JSON, XML, or custom binary formats.

3. **Security Measures**: Implement security measures like encryption and authentication to safeguard the communication between agents.

4. **Message Queuing**: Explain how message queuing or publish-subscribe mechanisms should be utilized for asynchronous communication.

5. **Error Handling**: Detail the error-handling mechanisms in place for failed communications or data corruption.

6. **Monitoring and Logging**: Describe the monitoring and logging solutions to be used for keeping track of communications.

7. **Documentation**: Update system documentation to include the new communication processes, specifying the role of each agent in the communication chain.

# Multi-Agent Communication Process

## Purpose
This document outlines the protocols and standards for communication between multiple agents within the AGI system.

## Scope
This standard applies to all agents within the AGI system, whether they are core agents or auxiliary agents.

## Communication Protocols
1. **Message Format**: All messages should adhere to a predefined message format that both the sender and receiver understand.
2. **Encryption**: Messages should be encrypted to ensure secure communication.
3. **Timeouts**: Set timeouts for message delivery and response to ensure system responsiveness.

## Steps for Agent Communication
1. **Identification**: Agents should authenticate each other before initiating communication.
2. **Information Exchange**: Agents should exchange necessary information using the agreed upon message format.
3. **Task Coordination**: Agents should coordinate tasks based on their roles and capabilities.
4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage potential issues during communication.
5. **Feedback Loop**: Agents should provide feedback to each other to confirm the completion of tasks or to request further action.

## Monitoring and Logging
- All communication between agents should be logged for auditing and debugging purposes.
