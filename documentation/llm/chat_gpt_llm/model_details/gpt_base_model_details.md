# GPT Base Models Overview

OpenAI's GPT base models are designed to understand and generate both natural language and code. Unlike their counterparts, these models lack the ability for instruction following. They are introduced as successors to the original GPT-3 base models and function using the legacy Completions API. It is recommended to opt for GPT-3.5 or GPT-4 models for most applications.
