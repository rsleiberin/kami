# GPT-3 Legacy Models - OpenAI API Documentation

## Overview
OpenAI's GPT-3 models are designed to understand and generate natural language. While they have been succeeded by the advanced GPT-3.5 generation models, the GPT-3 base models—davinci, curie, ada, and babbage—remain exclusive for fine-tuning purposes.

## Capabilities
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Can comprehend and generate human language with varying levels of proficiency depending on the specific model.
- **Fine-Tuning**: GPT-3 base models stand out as the only models within the GPT series that are available for fine-tuning, allowing users to adapt them to specific tasks.

## Models
- **text-curie-001**: Highly capable, offering faster processing and reduced cost compared to Davinci. Accommodates 2,049 tokens and trained up to Oct 2019.
- **text-babbage-001**: Suited for direct tasks, it's fast and cost-effective. Houses 2,049 tokens and trained till Oct 2019.
- **text-ada-001**: Designed for basic tasks, it's usually the speediest model in the GPT-3 lineup and the most economical. Contains 2,049 tokens with training data up to Oct 2019.
- **davinci**: The most proficient GPT-3 model, excelling in any task the other models can undertake, frequently with superior quality. Supports 2,049 tokens and trained up to Oct 2019.
- **curie**: Quite adept, but offers faster operations and reduced cost compared to Davinci. Contains 2,049 tokens and training data up to Oct 2019.
- **babbage**: Designed for clear-cut tasks, it operates swiftly and is cost-effective. Supports 2,049 tokens and trained up to Oct 2019.
- **ada**: Tailored for elementary tasks, it typically stands as the fastest model in the GPT-3 series and is the most cost-efficient. Holds 2,049 tokens with training data up to Oct 2019.
