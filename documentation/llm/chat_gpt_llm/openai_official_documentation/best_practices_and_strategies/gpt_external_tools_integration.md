# Integrating External Tools with GPT

To effectively mitigate the limitations of GPT models and optimize their performance, integrating them with external tools can be a powerful strategy. Such tools can help GPT models by taking over tasks that can be performed more reliably or efficiently by specialized systems. By leveraging the strengths of both GPT models and external tools, one can achieve enhanced results.

## Use External Tools

**Description**:
Harness the capabilities of external tools to augment and improve the outputs from GPT models. By pairing GPT with specialized systems, tasks that are beyond the model's expertise or efficiency can be offloaded, ensuring optimal performance.

**Tactics**:
- **Embeddings-based Search**: Implement knowledge retrieval mechanisms that are based on embeddings to search for relevant information efficiently.
  
- **Code Execution**: Allow GPT models to execute code to achieve accurate calculations or interact with external APIs. This offloads computational tasks from the model and ensures precision.
  
- **Function Access**: Equip the GPT model with the capability to access specific functions, further enhancing its utility and adaptability.

By integrating GPT with external tools, the combined system can achieve results that are more accurate, efficient, and reliable than using the GPT model alone.
