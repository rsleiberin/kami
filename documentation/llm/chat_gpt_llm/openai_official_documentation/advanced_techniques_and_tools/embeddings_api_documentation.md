# Embeddings Model - OpenAI API Documentation

## Overview
Embeddings are numerical representations that encapsulate the essence of text content. They play a pivotal role in gauging the similarity or relatedness between two text fragments.

## Key Features
- **Second Generation Model**: OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` is the latest in line, designed as an efficient successor to the initial 16 embedding models. This model offers comparable or even superior capabilities at a significantly reduced cost.
- **Applications**: The numerical representation rendered by embeddings is invaluable in a range of tasks:
  - Text search optimization
  - Data clustering
  - Recommendation systems
  - Anomaly detection
  - Text classification
- **Further Reading**: To delve deeper into the advancements and capabilities of the `text-embedding-ada-002`, the [announcement blog post](#) offers a comprehensive look.
