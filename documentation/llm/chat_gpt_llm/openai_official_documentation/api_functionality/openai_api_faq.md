# OpenAI API - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## Why are model outputs inconsistent?

The API is inherently non-deterministic. This implies that even if the input prompt remains unchanged, there might be slight variations in the model's output every time it's queried. However, by setting the `temperature` parameter to 0, you can achieve mostly deterministic outputs, though a minor level of variability will still persist.

## How should I set the temperature parameter?

Temperature is a parameter that balances between the consistency and creativity of the model's outputs. A lower temperature value will lead to more consistent and deterministic outputs. Conversely, a higher value will result in more diverse and creative responses. The ideal temperature setting depends on the specific needs of your application and the trade-off between coherence and originality you're aiming for.

## Is fine-tuning available for the latest models?

Yes, but only for certain models. As of now, fine-tuning is available for `gpt-3.5-turbo` and the updated base models, namely `babbage-002` and `davinci-002`. For a comprehensive guide on how to leverage fine-tuned models, refer to the fine-tuning documentation.

## Do you store the data that is passed into the API?

Effective from March 1st, 2023, while OpenAI retains the data sent via the API for a period of 30 days, it no longer utilizes this data to enhance its models. Further insights can be gleaned from our data usage policy. It's worth noting that certain API endpoints offer zero data retention.

## How can I make my application more safe?

If you aim to introduce a moderation layer to the outputs generated by the Chat API, OpenAI provides a moderation guide. This guide assists in filtering out outputs that might breach OpenAIâ€™s established usage policies.

## Should I use ChatGPT or the API?

ChatGPT presents a chat-based interface to interact with the models available in the OpenAI API. It boasts an array of integrated features, including but not limited to browsing capabilities, code execution, plugins, etc. On the other hand, the OpenAI API offers greater flexibility, making it more suitable for bespoke implementations.
