# Project Kami - Model Details

## Introduction
This directory focuses on the intricate details of various GPT models, including their specifications, capabilities, and unique features. It serves as a reference for both humans and AI agents to gain a comprehensive understanding of the different GPT models available.

## Status
- `In Progress`

## Tasks
The following tasks are listed in the suggested completion order:
- [ ] Familiarize with the specific details and capabilities of each GPT model.
- [ ] Document key takeaways and important specifications for each model.
- [ ] Review and update the model details as newer versions or updates become available.
- [ ] If all tasks are completed, update the README status to "COMPLETED" here and in the parent directory as instructed by `documentation/standards/coding_and_development/README_updates`.

## Special Considerations
### For Humans
Stay updated with the latest changes or updates related to GPT models. Always cross-reference details with OpenAI's official documentation for accuracy.

### For AIs
Ensure accurate representation of model details during interactions and adhere strictly to the provided documentation. Prioritize the latest model details during data exchanges.
