GPT best practices
This guide shares strategies and tactics for getting better results from GPTs. The methods described here can sometimes be deployed in combination for greater effect. We encourage experimentation to find the methods that work best for you.

Some of the examples demonstrated here currently work only with our most capable model, gpt-4. If you don't yet have access to gpt-4 consider joining the waitlist. In general, if you find that a GPT model fails at a task and a more capable model is available, it's often worth trying again with the more capable model.

Six strategies for getting better results
Write clear instructions
GPTs can’t read your mind. If outputs are too long, ask for brief replies. If outputs are too simple, ask for expert-level writing. If you dislike the format, demonstrate the format you’d like to see. The less GPTs have to guess at what you want, the more likely you’ll get it.

Tactics:

Include details in your query to get more relevant answers
Ask the model to adopt a persona
Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
Specify the steps required to complete a task
Provide examples
Specify the desired length of the output
