# Systematic Testing of GPT Models

To ensure the reliability and accuracy of GPT models, it is crucial to implement systematic testing. By creating a comprehensive test suite or evaluation (eval), one can effectively measure the performance of the model against a set of predefined benchmarks.

## Test Changes Systematically

**Description**:
Even though modifications to a prompt might show better performance in isolated instances, it could deteriorate the overall performance when assessed against a broader set of examples. Therefore, to ensure that a change genuinely enhances performance, it's imperative to implement a systematic testing process.

**Tactic**:
- **Gold-standard Evaluation**: When assessing the outputs generated by the model, it is beneficial to reference them against gold-standard answers. This method provides a benchmark to measure the accuracy and relevance of the model's responses. By comparing the outputs against these gold standards, one can identify areas of improvement and ensure that the model's performance aligns with the desired standards.

Systematic testing provides a structured approach to validate the improvements made to the GPT model, ensuring that the changes lead to genuine enhancements in performance.
