# Whisper Model - OpenAI API Documentation

## Overview
Whisper is a robust, general-purpose speech recognition model designed by OpenAI. It's adept at processing and understanding diverse audio sources, making it a versatile tool in the realm of speech recognition.

## Key Features
- **Multitasking Abilities**: Whisper isn't just limited to speech recognition. It's a multi-task model capable of handling multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and even language identification tasks.
- **Model Versions**: The current version available through OpenAI's API is `Whisper v2-large`, identifiable by the model name `whisper-1`.
- **Consistency with Open Source**: As of now, there's no distinction between the Whisper model available through OpenAI's API and its open-source counterpart. This ensures that developers can anticipate consistent behavior across platforms.
- **Optimized Inference**: Using Whisper via the OpenAI API offers an edge in speed. The API delivers an optimized inference process, ensuring faster speech recognition compared to alternative methods.
