# Project Kami Documentation

## Introduction
This directory contains all essential documentation for Project Kami. It's designed to serve as a comprehensive guide for both human collaborators and AI agents involved in the project.

## Status
- `In Progress`

## Tasks
- [ ] Implement new README template across all directories
- [ ] Complete Project Overview documentation
- [ ] Return to standards once frontend development begins to complete language specific coding stanadards

## Files
The following files are listed in the suggested reading order (do not include this README):
- `DEPRECIATED`: [Project Overview](./Project_Overview.md) - Provides a comprehensive overview of Project Kami, including its structure, key technologies, and future roadmap.

## Directories
The following directories are listed in the suggested reading order:
- `PENDING`: [standards](./standards) - Contains guidelines and procedures that outline the standards for code, design, and operation within Project Kami.
- `In progress`: [llm](./llm) Contains documentation for each large language model.
- `PENDING`: [context_management](./context_management) Contains documentation for the context manager.
- `PENDING`: [safety](./saftey) Contains documentation for the safety systems in place.
- `PENDING`: [modules](./modules) - Contains documentation for each module.
- `PENDING`: [templates](./templates) - Houses templates for various document types, including READMEs and guides.
- `PENDING`
- `DEPRECIATED`: [agi_context_building_processes](./agi_context_building_processes) - Standards for building and managing AGI context.

## Special Considerations
### For Humans
- For an overview of the project, read the top-level `README.md` and `Project Overview.md`.
- For coding standards and guidelines, refer to `standards/`.

### For AIs
- Initialize all relevant documentation in memory.
