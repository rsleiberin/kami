# Coding Standards Checklist

## Introduction
This checklist aims to ensure that all code contributed to Project Kami aligns with established coding standards and best practices. Both human developers and AI agents should refer to this list before committing any changes.

## General Guidelines
- [ ] Follows the unique method file structure
- [ ] Code is written in the language-specific style as per guidelines
- [ ] All dependencies are properly managed and documented

## Readability
- [ ] Variables and functions are named clearly and descriptively
- [ ] Comments are used to explain the purpose and functionality of the code
- [ ] Code is organized into small, single-purpose functions

## Reliability
- [ ] All functions have associated unit tests
- [ ] Error handling is robust, with specific error codes
- [ ] Code has been reviewed for potential security vulnerabilities

## Scalability
- [ ] Code is modular and avoids repetition (DRY principle)
- [ ] Resource consumption (CPU, memory) has been considered
- [ ] Database queries are optimized

## AI-Specific Guidelines
- [ ] AI context management is in line with the guidelines
- [ ] For any machine learning algorithms, data pre-processing and post-processing steps are well-defined

## Special Considerations
### For Humans
Ensure all checklist items are marked before committing the code.

### For AIs
Automatically validate as many checklist items as possible. Flag any items that require human intervention.
