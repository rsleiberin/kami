# MODULE REGISTRY PSEUDOCODE

# Current Task:
# - Refactor and streamline the ModuleRegistry to align with the primary goals of the Kami project.
# - Ensure each function in the ModuleRegistry serves a distinct and necessary role.
# - The LLM should be able to dynamically execute methods from connected modules while ensuring security and authorization.

# If lost, refer to:
# - Recent discussions about the purpose and functionality of each method in the ModuleRegistry.
# - The goals and intentions behind the Kami project.
# - Keywords: LLM, autonomy, execute methods, connected modules, dynamic execution, LLM switching, module management.

# Primary Goals of ModuleRegistry:
# 1. Module Management:
#    - Register and manage modules.
#    - Whitelist modules ensuring only authorized ones can be accessed by the LLM.
# 2. Dynamic Execution:
#    - Allow the LLM to dynamically execute methods from connected modules.
# 3. LLM Switching:
#    - Transition between different LLMs based on the task or context.

# Methods:
# 1. execute_module_method: Dynamically run methods from connected modules.
# 2. get_methods: Fetch doc strings of methods for understanding or documentation.
# 3. register_module: Essential for importing and whitelisting modules.

# Methods to Reassess:
# - get_model_for_task: Determine which LLM model to use.
# - get_registered_module_methods: Fetch methods from a registered module.
# - load_module_class: Purpose unclear. Possibly for dynamic module loading.
# - perform_task: Functionality unclear.
# - use_module: Possibly for utilizing a specific method from a registered module.

# Note:
# Always consider the context limitations of the LLM. Focus on clarifying the purpose of each method, removing redundancies, and ensuring distinct roles.
