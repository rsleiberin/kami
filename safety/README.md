# Project Kami - Safety & Permissions System

## Introduction
The Safety & Permissions System directory ensures the secure execution of all operations, especially external function calls. It plays a pivotal role in maintaining the integrity and safety of the entire project by overseeing every action and vetting it against established safety protocols.

## Status
- `In Progress`

## Tasks
- [ ] Read and adhere to the guidelines in `documentation/standards/coding_and_development/coding_workflow.md`.
- [ ] Document existing safety protocols and whitelists.
- [ ] Refine the whitelist mechanism for more robust checks.
- [ ] Develop dynamic permission checks adaptable to evolving project needs.
- [ ] Implement real-time safety checks for any external call.
- [ ] Regularly review and update safety protocols.
- [ ] Test the system with potential edge cases.
- [ ] Update the README as tasks progress.

## Files
- `In Progress`: [whitelist.py](./whitelist.py) - Maintains and checks the whitelist of allowed operations.

(Additional files to be added as development progresses)

## Directories
(None currently available)

## Special Considerations
### For Humans
Always prioritize safety over efficiency. Ensure that every new feature or change undergoes rigorous safety checks.

### For AIs
Never bypass the whitelist or safety checks. Always report any anomalies or suspicious requests.
