Project Kami README

Getting Started
This README is a breif overview of Project Kami. To get started, please continue reading in the documentation directory.

Introduction and Vision
Kami are digital entities designed to act as intelligent agents, representing the essence of humans, natural systems, or any complex abstraction. They are given stable and evolving contextual strings, which form a semblance of ongoing thought and agency. Project Kami extends the power of language by creating Personal AGI that understand us through data, acting as extensions of ourselves. These entities serve to offload personal cognitive and memory tasks, accessible anytime through language-based requests. Through Project Kami, we seek to create a more harmonious and intelligent interaction between all systems.

Initial Product Offering
The primary focus of Project Kami will be on Personal AGI and a GUI for module creation. The Personal AGI will act as a user's digital self, mediating interactions with other Kami and digital systems. The GUI will serve as an interface for users to interact with their Personal AGI and to create new modules that can be adopted and used by other AGI through a marketplace.

Human in the Loop: An Integral Part of the System
Human involvement serves as a crucial safety mechanism in Project Kami. For some modules to function, a human agent will be needed to act as a mediator or a verifier. This ensures that the actions taken by AGI align with ethical and safety standards. Over time, the role of humans may evolve into that of collaborators or even employees hired by AGI for specific tasks.

AGI Active Loop
Once initialized, Kami enter an active loop where they self-manage tasks and occasionally request permissions for new actions. They work continuously in the background, responding to events and user inputs. In some cases, they may actively attempt to hire or recruit humans to perform tasks on their behalf, thereby creating a symbiotic relationship.

Context Management
Project Kami emphasizes robust context management to allow for stable and evolving identities among the Kami. This will be particularly useful in creating a digital self that aligns closely with the user's or system's real-world context.

Future Extensions
Project Kami is designed to be open-source and modular, allowing for a multitude of future extensions. As the project matures, we anticipate the evolution of a premium marketplace where users can offer and adopt advanced AGI modules. However, the open-source nature of the project will always be maintained.
