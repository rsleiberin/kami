# Continuous Learning Phase

# Purpose:
# This phase ensures that the AGI continually observes its interactions, learns from them, and adjusts its behavior accordingly. It strives for self-improvement based on real-world data.

# Pseudo Code:
while AGI is active:
    interactions = fetch_recent_interactions()
    # Fetch the recent interactions the AGI had with users, environment, or other agents.

    patterns, anomalies = LearningSocket.analyze(interactions)
    # Analyze these interactions to identify patterns, anomalies, or areas of improvement.

    if anomalies detected:
        alert = LearningSocket.alert_on_anomalies(anomalies)
        notify_user_or_system(alert)
        # If any anomalies are detected, the system might alert the user or take corrective actions.

    improvements = LearningSocket.derive_improvements(patterns)
    # Based on the observed patterns, derive potential improvements.

    for improvement in improvements:
        apply_improvement(improvement)
        # Apply the improvements to the system.

    wait_for_next_learning_cycle()
    # This can be based on a set time interval, a number of interactions, or other triggers.
# Continuous Learning
