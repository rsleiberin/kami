SelfReviewSocket:

Responsible for periodically reviewing the system components to identify and decommission any outdated or redundant elements.

class SelfReviewSocket:

    - Initialization:
        Set up attributes to track outdated components and review intervals. Track the last review date.

    - perform_review():
        If the time since the last review exceeds the review interval, identify outdated components.

    - identify_outdated_components():
        Examine each system component for signs of being outdated. This involves checking factors such as last usage date, efficiency metrics, etc.

    - decommission_outdated_components():
        For each identified outdated component, decommission it.

    # Note: The actual implementation would interact with a list of all system components (`all_system_components`) and use specific methods like `is_outdated` and `decommission`.
