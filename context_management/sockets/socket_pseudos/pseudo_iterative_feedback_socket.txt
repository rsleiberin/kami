IterativeFeedbackSocket:

The IterativeFeedbackSocket handles continuous code refinement based on iterative feedback. It aims to ensure the integrated code aligns with user intent and system standards.

class IterativeFeedbackSocket:

    - Initialization:
        - Set up the iteration count and define a maximum number of iterations.

    - is_feedback_satisfactory(feedback):
        Determine if the feedback indicates that the code is up to standard. For example, feedback with severity below a certain threshold might be deemed satisfactory.

    - loop_for_adjustments(code, feedback):
        Continuously modify the code based on feedback until satisfactory or until a maximum number of iterations is reached.
