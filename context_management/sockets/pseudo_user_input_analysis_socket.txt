user_input = UserInputAnalysisSocket.capture_user_input()
socket_instance = UserInputAnalysisSocket()

Note: The above is a simple pseudo-code representation. In actual implementation, the analyze method would likely involve more complex operations and possibly integration with trained models or algorithms to determine user intent accurately.
