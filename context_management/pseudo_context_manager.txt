class ContextManager:

    Initialize:
        - Set up the core and auxiliary sockets.
        - Set up a buffer to store context data.
        - Set the default token limit.
        - Load user preferences and past interactions.

    Method load_user_data:
        - Load user preferences and past interactions.
        - Fetch data from storage (could be a database or local file).
        - Update the current context with this data.

    Method add_socket(socket_name, socket_instance):
        - Add a new socket instance to active_sockets.

    Method process_socket(socket_name, *args, **kwargs):
        - Process a specific socket and retrieve its context.
        - Add the context data to context_buffer.
        - Manage the token limit to ensure it's not exceeded.

    Method manage_token_limit:
        - Manage the context to fit within the token limit.
        - Implement strategies like truncation or prioritization when token limit is exceeded.

    Method get_context:
        - Retrieve the current context buffer.

    Method activate_socket(socket_name, socket_instance):
        - Activate (or add) a specific socket for specialized context processing.

    Method deactivate_socket(socket_name):
        - Deactivate (or remove) a specific socket, stopping its context processing.

    Method get_context_for_LLMSwitcher:
        - Prepare and return the context tailored for the LLM switcher.

    Method clear_context:
        - Clear the context buffer.

    Method update_token_limit(new_limit):
        - Update the token limit.

    Method save_context:
        - Persistently save the current context.
        - Implement the saving logic, whether to a file or database.
