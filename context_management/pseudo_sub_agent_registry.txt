SubAgentRegistry Pseudo-Code Enhancement:
The SubAgentRegistry maintains a record of all active sub-agents within the AGI system. This registry provides methods to add, remove, pause, resume, and query the status of sub-agents.

Initialization:
Initialize an empty list to keep track of active sub-agents.

Registration:
Add a new sub-agent instance to the active list. Ensure each sub-agent has a unique identifier.

Deregistration:
Remove a sub-agent instance from the active list based on its unique identifier.

Active Agents:
Fetch and return a list of all currently active sub-agents.

Agent Status:
Query and return the status of a specific sub-agent using its unique identifier.

Pause Agent:
Pause the operations of a specific sub-agent based on its unique identifier.

Resume Agent:
Resume the operations of a paused sub-agent based on its unique identifier.

Terminate Agent:
Forcefully stop the operations of a specific sub-agent and remove it from the active list.

Error Handling:
Implement mechanisms to handle potential issues, such as trying to deregister a non-existent sub-agent or querying the status of an agent not in the active list.
